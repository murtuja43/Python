1. # Start with a Letter or Underscore
# A variable name should start with a letter, like a, b, c, or an underscore _. It cannot start with a number.

# Examples:
apple = 5
_apple = 6
1apple = 10 #invalid due to number in the beginning


2. # No Spaces Allowed
# You cannot use spaces in variable names. Use an underscore _ instead.

# Example:
my_cat = "Meeka" #valid
my cat = "Meeka" #Invalid due to space in between


3. # Case Matters
# small and Small are different in Python. So, be careful with big and small letters!

# Example:
apple = 5
Apple = 10


4. # Don't Use Python Keywords
# Python has special words called keywords. We cannot use them as variable names.

# Examples:
and, for, while, if, True, False


5. # No Special Symbols Like '@'
# You cannot use special symbols like @ in variable names. Only letters, numbers, and underscores are allowed.

# Example:
@apple = 5 #invalid due to @ symbol
app@le = 6 #invalid due to @ symbol
